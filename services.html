        <h3>ðŸ–¼ Custom Image Datasets</h3>
        <p>
          <i>At DuckData, we specialize in creating custom image datasets tailored specifically to your machine learning and AI training needs. Whether youâ€™re working on object detection, facial recognition, OCR, or medical imaging, we can provide datasets that match your exact requirements. Our team ensures that every image is clearly labeled, accurately tagged, and quality-checked for consistency and usability. We support a wide variety of formats including JPEG, PNG, and TIFF and can deliver annotated data in YOLO, COCO, or Pascal VOC formats. We work with you from the planning phase to understand the kind of objects, scenarios, or lighting conditions needed. Using high-resolution cameras and a professional team, we gather fresh data rather than using recycled public datasets. This gives your model the advantage of clean, contextually rich inputs. From industrial inspection to e-commerce tagging, our image datasets bring better results to your models. We provide balanced datasets to avoid bias and make your AI solutions more robust. Whether you need 500 or 5 million images, we scale flexibly. With DuckData, your image datasets are not just deliveredâ€”theyâ€™re engineered.</i>

        <h3>ðŸŽž Custom Video Datasets</h3>
        <p>
          <i>Our custom video dataset service is built for AI and ML companies looking for realistic, scenario-based, and annotated video samples. We capture real-world conditions using a wide range of devices, including 4K drones, DSLRs, smartphones, and CCTV-like setups. Our videos are recorded in varied lighting, environmental, and demographic conditions, ensuring training models that generalize well in production. From pedestrian tracking to gesture recognition and retail surveillance, we provide datasets that mimic the actual use-case. Every video is processed, stabilized if needed, trimmed, and annotated frame-by-frame or segment-by-segment based on your requirements. Bounding boxes, object paths, activity tags, and temporal events are all supported. Our team can even simulate events like store theft, industrial machine operation, or sports actions to give precise context. We maintain strict privacy and compliance by anonymizing faces or license plates where necessary. Each dataset can be exported with metadata and structured JSON, XML, or CSV labels. If your startup needs to train an action detection model or real-time vision AI, DuckDataâ€™s custom video datasets provide the fuel. We bring realism, structure, and clarity to complex AI video training needs.</i>
